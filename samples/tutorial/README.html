Attendees used a presupplied virtual machine preconfigured with Oracle Database, Python 3.6, cx_Oracle 6.0, a text editor, and access to a terminal console. To set up a similar environment yourself, install: * Python 3.6 * cx_Oracle 6.0 * Oracle Database 12c It is easist to have a local pluggable database with the service 'orclpdb' configured. If your database is not local, or has a different service, you will need to modify the connect string in all samples. To create the schema run:

<pre>sqlplus sys/yoursyspassword@localhost/orclpdb as sysdba @sql/SetupSamples
</pre>

The following sections may need adjusting, depending on how you have set up your environment. ## <a name="overview">Overview</a> This tutorial is an introduction to using Python with Oracle Database. It contains beginner and advanced material. Sections can be done in any order. Choose the content that interests you and your skill level. Follow the steps in this document. The home directory has scripts to run and modify. The `solutions` directory has scripts with the suggested code changes. Use the Desktop icons to start editors and terminal windows. A pre-created schema exists. The username is "pythonhol" with the password "welcome". The connect string is "localhost/orclpdb". See `sql/SampleEnv.sql`. If you are new to Python review the [Appendix: Python Primer](#primer) to gain an understanding of the language. ## <a name="lab">Using Python cx_Oracle 6 with Oracle Database 12c</a> Python is a popular general purpose dynamic scripting language. The cx_Oracle interface provides Python API to access Oracle Database. * ### <a name="connecting">1\. Connecting to Oracle</a> * #### 1.1 Creating a basic connection Review the code contained in `connect.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        print("Database version:", con.version)
        </pre>

The cx_Oracle module is imported to provide the API for accessing the Oracle database. Many inbuilt and third party modules can be included in this way in Python scripts. The `connect()` method is passed the username "pythonhol", the password "welcome" and the connection string. In this case, Oracle's Easy Connect connection string syntax is used. It consists of the hostname of your machine, `localhost`, and the database service name `orclpdb`. Open a command terminal and run:

<pre>**python connect.py**</pre>

The version number of the database should be displayed. An exception is raised if the connection fails. Adjust the username, password or connect string parameters to invalid values to see the exception. cx_Oracle also supports "external authentication", which allows connections without needing usernames and passwords to be embedded in the code. Authentication will instead be performed by, for example, LDAP. * #### 1.2 Indentation indicates code structure There are no statement terminators or begin/end keywords or braces to indicate blocks of code. Open `connect.py` in an editor. Indent the print statement with some spaces and save the file:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
          print("Database version:", con.version)
        </pre>

Run the script again:

<pre>**python connect.py** </pre>

This raises an exception about the indentation. The number of spaces or tabs must be consistent in each block; otherwise, the Python interpreter will either raise an exception or execute code unexpectedly. Python may not always be able to identify accidental from deliberate indentation. _Check your indentation is correct before running each example. Make sure to indent all statement blocks equally._ **Note the sample files use spaces, not tabs.** * #### 1.3 Executing a query Open `query.py` in an editor. It looks like:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        </pre>

Edit the file and add the code shown in bold below:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        **cur = con.cursor()
        cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
        res = cur.fetchall()
        for row in res:
            print(row)**
        </pre>

_Make sure the `print(row)` line is indented._ The code executes a query and fetches all data. Save the file and run it:

<pre>**python query.py**</pre>

In each loop iteration a new row is stored in `row` as a Python "tuple" and is displayed. Fetching data is described further in [section 3](#fetching). * #### 1.4 Closing connections Connections and other resources used by cx_Oracle will automatically be closed at the end of scope. This is a common programming style. Resources can also be explicitly closed to free up database resources if they are no longer needed. Open `query.py` in an editor and add a call to `close()` like:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        cur = con.cursor()
        cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
        res = cur.fetchall()
        for row in res:
            print(row)

        **con.close()**
        </pre>

Run the script:

<pre>**python query.py**</pre>

This gives the error "cx_Oracle.DatabaseError: DPI-1054: connection cannot be closed when open statements or LOBs exist". To fix this, edit the file and close the cursor:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        cur = con.cursor()
        cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
        res = cur.fetchall()
        for row in res:
            print(row)

        **cur.close()**
        con.close()
        </pre>

If you run the script again, it will succeed without error. In your own applications, you may prefer to let cx_Oracle automatically close resources at end of scope. * #### 1.5 Checking versions Review the code contained in `versions.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        print(cx_Oracle.version)</pre>

Run the script:

<pre>**python versions.py**</pre>

This gives the version of the cx_Oracle interface. Edit the file to print the version of the database, and of the Oracle client libraries used by cx_Oracle:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        print(cx_Oracle.version)
        **print("Database version:", con.version)
        print("Client version:", cx_Oracle.clientversion())**
        </pre>

When the script is run, it will display:

<pre>6.0.2
        Database version: 12.2.0.1.0
        Client version: (12, 2, 0, 1, 0)
        </pre>

Note the client version is a tuple. An application can support multiple Oracle versions. By checking the Oracle Database and client versions numbers, the application can make use of the best Oracle features available. * ### <a name="pooling">2\. Connection Pooling</a> * #### 2.1 Session pooling Review the code contained in `connect_pool.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        import threading

        pool = cx_Oracle.**SessionPool**("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb",
                                     min = 2, max = 5, increment = 1, threaded = True)

        def Query():
            con = pool.**acquire**()
            cur = con.cursor()
            for i in range(4):
                cur.execute("select myseq.nextval from dual")
                seqval, = cur.fetchone()
                print("Thread", threading.current_thread().name, "fetched sequence =", seqval)

        thread1 = threading.Thread(name='#1', target=Query)
        thread1.start()

        thread2 = threading.Thread(name='#2', target=Query)
        thread2.start()

        thread1.join()
        thread2.join()

        print("All done!")
        </pre>

The `SessionPool()` function creates a pool of Oracle "sessions" for the "pythonhol" user. Sessions in the pool can be used by cx_Oracle connections by calling `pool.acquire()`. The initial pool size is 2 sessions. The maximum size is 5 sessions. When the pool needs to grow, 1 new session will be created at a time. The pool can shrink back to the minimum size of 2 when sessions are no longer in use. The `def Query():` line creates a method that is called by each thread. In the method, the `pool.acquire()` call gets one session from the pool (as long as less than 5 are already in use). This session is used in a loop of 4 iterations to query the sequence `myseq`. At the end of the method, cx_Oracle will automatically close the cursor and release the session back to the pool for reuse. The `seqval, = cur.fetchone()` line fetches a row and puts the single value contained in the result tuple into the variable `seqval`. Without the comma, the value in seqval would be a tuple like "`(1,)`". Two threads are created, each invoking the `Query()` method. In a command terminal, run:

<pre>**python connect_pool.py**</pre>

The output shows interleaved query results as each thread fetches values independently. The order of interleaving may vary from run to run. * #### 2.2 Session pool experiments Review `connect_pool2.py`, which has a loop for the number of threads:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        import threading

        pool = cx_Oracle.SessionPool("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb",
                                     min = 2, max = 5, increment = 1, threaded = True)

        def Query():
            con = pool.acquire()
            cur = con.cursor()
            for i in range(4):
                cur.execute("select myseq.nextval from dual")
                seqval, = cur.fetchone()
                print("Thread", threading.current_thread().name, "fetched sequence =", seqval)

        **numberOfThreads = 2
        threadArray = []

        for i in range(numberOfThreads):
            thread = threading.Thread(name = '#' + str(i), target = Query)
            threadArray.append(thread)
            thread.start()

        for t in threadArray:
            t.join()**

        print("All done!")
        </pre>

In a command terminal, run:

<pre>**python connect_pool2.py**</pre>

Experiment with different values of the pool parameters and `numberOfThreads`. Larger initial pool sizes will make the pool creation slower, but the sessions will be available immediately when needed. When `numberOfThreads` exceeds the maximum size of the pool, the `acquire()` call will generate an error. Adding the additional argument `getmode = cx_Oracle.SPOOL_ATTRVAL_WAIT` to the `cx_Oracle.SessionPool()` call will prevent the exception from taking place, but will cause the thread to wait until a session is available. * #### 2.3 Creating a DRCP Connection Database Resident Connection Pooling allows multiple Python processes on multiple machines to share a small pool of database server processes. Below left is a diagram without DRCP. Every application connection or session has its own 'dedicated' database server process. Application connect and close calls require the expensive create and destroy of those database server processes. To avoid these costs, scripts may hold connections open even when not doing database work: these idle server processes consumes database host resources. Below right is a diagram with DRCP. Scripts can use database servers from a precreated pool of servers and return them when they are not in use.

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="30" border="0">

</tbody>

</table>

DRCP is useful when the database host machine does not have enough memory to handled the number of database server processes required. However, if database host memory is large enough, then the default, 'dedicated' server process model is generally recommended. If DRCP is enabled, it is best used in conjunction with cx_Oracle session pooling. Batch scripts doing long running jobs should generally use dedicated connections. Both dedicated and DRCP servers can be used in the same database for different applications. Review the code contained in `connect_drcp.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb**:pooled**",
                                cclass="PYTHONHOL", purity=cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_SELF)
        print("Database version:", con.version)
        </pre>

This is similar to `connect.py` but "`:pooled`" is appended to the connection string, telling the database to use a pooled server. A Connection Class "PYTHONHOL" is also passed into the `connect()` method to allow grouping of database servers to applications. The "purity" of the connection is defined as the `ATTR_PURITY_SELF` constant, meaning the session state (such as the default date format) might be retained between connection calls, giving performance benefits. Session information will be discarded if a pooled server is later reused by an application with a different connection class name. Applications that should never share session information should use a different connection class and/or use `ATTR_PURITY_NEW` to force creation of a new session. This reduces overall scalability but prevents applications mis-using session information. Run `connect_drcp.py` in a terminal window.

<pre>**python connect_drcp.py**</pre>

The output is simply the version of the database. * #### 2.4 Session pooling and DRCP DRCP works well with session pooling. Edit `connect_pool2.py` and modify it to use DRCP:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        import threading

        pool = cx_Oracle.SessionPool("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb**:pooled**",
                                     min = 2, max = 5, increment = 1, threaded = True)

        def Query():
            con = pool.acquire(**cclass = "PYTHONHOL", purity = cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_SELF**)
            cur = conn.cursor()
            for i in range(4):
                cur.execute("select myseq.nextval from dual")
                seqval, = cur.fetchone()
                print("Thread", threading.current_thread().name, "fetched sequence =", seqval)

        numberOfThreads = 2
        threadArray = []

        for i in range(numberOfThreads):
            thread = threading.Thread(name = '#' + str(i), target = Query)
            threadArray.append(thread)
            thread.start()

        for t in threadArray:
            t.join()

        print("All done!")
        </pre>

The script logic does not need to be changed to benefit from DRCP connection pooling. Run the script:

<pre>**python connect_pool2.py**</pre>

Open a new a terminal window and invoke SQL*Plus:

<pre>**sqlplus /nolog @drcp_query.sql**</pre>

This shows the number of connection requests made to the pool since the database was started ("NUM_REQUESTS"), how many of those reused a pooled server's session ("NUM_HITS"), and how many had to create new sessions ("NUM_MISSES"). Typically the goal is a low number of misses. To see the pool configuration you can query DBA_CPOOL_INFO. * #### 2.5 More DRCP investigation To explore the behaviors of session and DRCP pooling futher, you could include the `time` module at the file top:

<pre>import time</pre>

and add calls to `time.sleep(1)` in the code, for example in the query loop. Then use `drcp_query.sql` to monitor pooled behavior. Also try changing the purity to `cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_NEW` to see the effect on the DRCP NUM_MISSES statistic. * ### <a name="fetching">3\. Fetching Data</a> * #### 3.1 A simple query There are a number of functions you can use to query an Oracle database, but the basics of querying are always the same: 1\. Parse the statement for execution. 2\. Bind data values (optional). 3\. Execute the statement. 4\. Fetch the results from the database. Review the code contained in `query2.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        cur = con.cursor()
        cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
        for deptno, dname, loc in cur:
            print("Department number: ", deptno)
            print("Department name: ", dname)
            print("Department location:", loc)
        </pre>

The `cursor()` method opens a cursor for statements to use. The `execute()` method parses and executes the statement. The loop fetches each row from the cursor and unpacks the returned tuple into the variables `deptno`, `dname`, `loc`, which are then printed. Run the script in a terminal window:

<pre>**python query2.py**</pre>

* #### 3.2 Using fetchone() When the number of rows is large, the `fetchall()` call may use too much memory. Review the code contained in `query_one.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
        row = cur.fetchone()
        print(row)

        row = cur.fetchone()
        print(row)
        </pre>

This uses the `fetchone()` method to return just a single row as a tuple. When called multiple time, consecutive rows are returned: Run the script in a terminal window:

<pre>**python query_one.py**</pre>

The first two rows of the table are printed. * #### 3.3 Using fetchmany() Review the code contained in `query_many.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")
        res = cur.fetchmany(numRows = 3)
        print(res)
        </pre>

The `fetchmany()` method returns a list of tuples. By default the number of rows returned is specified by the cursor attribute `arraysize`. Here the `numRows` parameter specifies that three rows should be returned. Run the script in a terminal window:

<pre>**python query_many.py**</pre>

The first three rows of the table are returned as a list (Python's name for an array) of tuples. You can access elements of the lists by position indexes. To see this, edit the file and add:

<pre>**print(res[0])**    # first row
        **print(res[0][1])** # second element of first row
        </pre>

* #### 3.4 Scrollable cursors Scrollable cursors enable the application to move backwards as well as forwards in query results. They can be used to skip rows as well as move to a particular row. Review the code contained in `query_scroll.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor(scrollable = True)

        cur.execute("select * from dept order by deptno")

        cur.scroll(2, mode = "absolute")  # go to second row
        print(cur.fetchone())

        cur.scroll(-1)                    # go back one row
        print(cur.fetchone())
        </pre>

Run the script in a terminal window:

<pre>**python query_scroll.py**</pre>

Edit `query_scroll.py` and experiment with different scroll options and orders, such as:

<pre>cur.scroll(1)  # go to next row
        print(cur.fetchone())

        cur.scroll(mode = "first")  # go to first row
        print(cur.fetchone())
        </pre>

Try some scroll options that go beyond the number of rows in the resultset. * #### 3.5 Tuning with arraysize This section demonstrates a way to improve query performance by increasing the number of rows returned in each batch from Oracle to the Python program. First, create a table with a large number of rows. Review `query_arraysize.sql`:

<pre>create table bigtab (mycol varchar2(20));
        begin
          for i in 1..20000
          loop
           insert into bigtab (mycol) values (dbms_random.string('A',20));
          end loop;
        end;
        /
        show errors

        commit;
        </pre>

In a terminal window run the script as:

<pre>**sqlplus /nolog @query_arraysize.sql**</pre>

Review the code contained in `query_arraysize.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        import time

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        start = time.time()

        cur = con.cursor()
        cur.arraysize = 10
        cur.execute("select * from bigtab")
        res = cur.fetchall()
        # print(res)  # uncomment to display the query results

        elapsed = (time.time() - start)
        print(elapsed, "seconds")
        </pre>

This uses the 'time' module to measure elapsed time of the query. The arraysize is set to 10\. This causes batches of 10 records at a time to be returned from the database to a cache in Python. This reduces the number of "roundtrips" made to the database, often reducing network load and reducing the number of context switches on the database server. The `fetchone()`, `fetchmany()` and `fetchall()` methods will read from the cache before requesting more data from the database. In a terminal window, run:

<pre>**python query_arraysize.py**</pre>

Reload a few times to see the average times. Experiment with different arraysize values. For example, edit `query_arraysize.py` and change the arraysize to:

<pre>cur.arraysize = **2000**</pre>

Rerun the script to compare the performance of different arraysize settings. In general, larger array sizes improve performance. Depending on how fast your system is, you may need to use different arraysizes than those given here to see a meaningful time difference. The default arraysize used by cx_Oracle 6 is 100\. There is a time/space tradeoff for increasing the arraysize. Larger arraysizes will require more memory in Python for buffering the records. If you know a query only returns a few records, consider decreasing the arraysize from the default to reduce memory usage. * ### <a name="binding">4\. Binding Data</a> Bind variables enable you to re-execute statements with new data values, without the overhead of reparsing the statement. Bind variables improve code reusability, and can reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks. * #### 4.1 Binding in queries Review the code contained in `bind_query.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        cur.prepare("select * from dept where deptno = :id order by deptno")

        cur.execute(None, id = 20)
        res = cur.fetchall()
        print(res)

        cur.execute(None, id = 10)
        res = cur.fetchall()
        print(res)
        </pre>

The statement contains a bind variable "`:id`" placeholder. The statement is only prepared once but executed twice with different values for the `WHERE` clause. The special symbol "`None`" is used in place of the statement text argument to `execute()` because the `prepare()` method has already set the statement. The second argument to the `execute()` call can be a sequence (binding by position) or a dictionary (binding by name) or an arbitrary number of named arguments (also binding by name), which is what has been done in this example. In the first execute call, this dictionary has the value 20 for the key of "id". The second execute uses the value 10\. From a terminal window, run:

<pre>**python bind_query.py**</pre>

The output shows the details for the two departments. * #### 4.2 Binding in inserts Review the code in `bind_insert.sql` creating a table for inserting data:

<pre>create table mytab (id number, data varchar2(20), constraint my_pk primary key (id));
        </pre>

Run the script as:

<pre>**sqlplus /nolog @bind_insert.sql**</pre>

Review the code contained in `bind_insert.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        rows = [ (1, "First" ), (2, "Second" ),
                 (3, "Third" ), (4, "Fourth" ),
                 (5, "Fifth" ), (6, "Sixth" ),
                 (7, "Seventh" ) ]

        cur.executemany("insert into mytab(id, data) values (:1, :2)", rows)

        # Now query the results back

        cur2 = con.cursor()
        cur2.execute('select * from mytab')
        res = cur2.fetchall()
        print(res)
        </pre>

The '`rows`' array contains the data to be inserted. The `executemany()` call inserts all rows. This calls allows "array binding", which is an efficient way to insert multiple records. The final part of the script queries the results back and displays them as a list of tuples. From a terminal window, run:

<pre>**python bind_insert.py**</pre>

The new results are automatically rolled back at the end of the script so re-running it will always show the same number of rows in the table. * #### 4.3 Batcherrors The Batcherrors features allows invalid data to be identified while allowing valid data to be inserted. Edit the data values in `bind_insert.py` and create a row with a duplicate key:

<pre>rows = [ (1, "First" ), (2, "Second" ),
                 (3, "Third" ), (4, "Fourth" ),
                 (5, "Fifth" ), (6, "Sixth" ),
                 **(6, "Duplicate" ),**
                 (7, "Seventh" ) ]

        </pre>

From a terminal window, run:

<pre>**python bind_insert.py**</pre>

The duplicate generates the error "ORA-00001: unique constraint (PYTHONHOL.MY_PK) violated". The data is rolled back and the query returns no rows. Edit the file again and enable `batcherrors` like:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        rows = [ (1, "First" ), (2, "Second" ),
                 (3, "Third" ), (4, "Fourth" ),
                 (5, "Fifth" ), (6, "Sixth" ),
                 **(6, "Duplicate" ),**
                 (7, "Seventh" ) ]

        cur.executemany("insert into mytab(id, data) values (:1, :2)", rows**, batcherrors = True**)

        **for error in cur.getbatcherrors():
            print("Error", error.message.rstrip(), "at row offset", error.offset)**

        # Now query the results back

        cur2 = con.cursor()
        cur2.execute('select * from mytab')
        res = cur2.fetchall()
        print(res)
        </pre>

Run the file:

<pre>**python bind_insert.py**</pre>

The new code shows the offending duplicate row: "ORA-00001: unique constraint (PYTHONHOL.MY_PK) violated at row offset 6" The other data gets inserted and is queried back. At the end of the script, cx_Oracle will rollback an uncommitted transaction. If you want to commit results, you can use:

<pre>con.commit()</pre>

To force a rollback in cx_Oracle, use:

<pre>con.rollback()</pre>

* #### 4.4 Binding named objects cx_Oracle can fetch and bind named object types such as Oracle's Spatial Data Objects (SDO). In a terminal window, start SQL*Plus:

<pre>sqlplus pythonhol/welcome@localhost/orclpdb
        </pre>

Use the SQL*Plus DESCRIBE command to look at the SDO definition:

<pre>desc MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY
        </pre>

It contains various attributes and methods. The top level description is:

<pre> Name                                      Null?    Type
         ----------------------------------------- -------- ----------------------------
         SDO_GTYPE                                          NUMBER
         SDO_SRID                                           NUMBER
         SDO_POINT                                          MDSYS.SDO_POINT_TYPE
         SDO_ELEM_INFO                                      MDSYS.SDO_ELEM_INFO_ARRAY
         SDO_ORDINATES                                      MDSYS.SDO_ORDINATE_ARRAY
        </pre>

Review the code contained in `bind_sdo.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        # Create table
        cur.execute("""begin
                         execute immediate 'drop table testgeometry';
                         exception when others then
                           if sqlcode <> -942 then
                             raise;
                           end if;
                       end;""")
        cur.execute("""create table testgeometry (
                       id number(9) not null,
                       geometry MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY not null)""")

        # Create and populate Oracle objects
        typeObj = con.**gettype**("MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY")
        elementInfoTypeObj = con.**gettype**("MDSYS.SDO_ELEM_INFO_ARRAY")
        ordinateTypeObj = con.**gettype**("MDSYS.SDO_ORDINATE_ARRAY")
        obj = typeObj.**newobject()**
        obj.SDO_GTYPE = 2003
        obj.SDO_ELEM_INFO = elementInfoTypeObj.**newobject()**
        obj.SDO_ELEM_INFO.**extend**([1, 1003, 3])
        obj.SDO_ORDINATES = ordinateTypeObj.**newobject()**
        obj.SDO_ORDINATES.**extend**([1, 1, 5, 7])
        print("Created object", obj)

        # Add a new row
        print("Adding row to table...")
        cur.execute("insert into testgeometry values (1, :objbv)", objbv = obj)
        print("Row added!")

        # Query the row
        print("Querying row just inserted...")
        cur.execute("select id, geometry from testgeometry");
        for row in cur:
            print(row)
        </pre>

This uses `gettype()` to get the database types of the SDO and its object attributes. The `newobject()` calls create Python representations of those objects. The python object atributes are then set. Oracle VARRAY types such as SDO_ELEM_INFO_ARRAY are set with `extend()`. Run the file:

<pre>**python bind_sdo.py**</pre>

The new SDO is shown as an object, similar to:

<pre>(1, <cx_oracle.object mdsys.sdo_geometry="" at="" 0x104a76230="">)</cx_oracle.object></pre>

To show the attribute values, edit the file so the query code (below the existing comment "`# Query the row`") is like:

<pre># Define a function to dump the contents of an Oracle object
        def dumpobject(obj, prefix = "  "):
            if obj.type.iscollection:
                print(prefix, "[")
                for value in obj.aslist():
                    if isinstance(value, cx_Oracle.Object):
                        dumpobject(value, prefix + "  ")
                    else:
                        print(prefix + "  ", repr(value))
                print(prefix, "]")
            else:
                print(prefix, "{")
                for attr in obj.type.attributes:
                    value = getattr(obj, attr.name)
                    if isinstance(value, cx_Oracle.Object):
                        print(prefix + "  " + attr.name + " :")
                        dumpobject(value, prefix + "    ")
                    else:
                        print(prefix + "  " + attr.name + " :", repr(value))
                print(prefix, "}")

        # Query the row
        print("Querying row just inserted...")
        cur.execute("select id, geometry from testgeometry")
        for id, obj in cur:
            print("Id: ", id)
            dumpobject(obj)
        </pre>

Run the file again:

<pre>**python bind_sdo.py**</pre>

This shows

<pre>Querying row just inserted...
        Id:  1
           {
            SDO_GTYPE : 2003.0
            SDO_SRID : None
            SDO_POINT : None
            SDO_ELEM_INFO :
               [
                 1.0
                 1003.0
                 3.0
               ]
            SDO_ORDINATES :
               [
                 1.0
                 1.0
                 5.0
                 7.0
               ]
           }
        </pre>

To explore further, try setting the SDO attribute SDO_POINT, which is of type SDO_POINT_TYPE. The `gettype()` and `newobject()` methods can also be used to bind PL/SQL Records and Collections. * ### <a name="plsql">5\. PL/SQL</a> PL/SQL is Oracle's procedural language extension to SQL. PL/SQL procedures and functions are stored and run in the database. Using PL/SQL lets all database applications reuse logic, no matter how the application accesses the database. Many data-related operations can be performed in PL/SQL faster than extracting the data into a program (for example, Python) and then processing it. * #### 5.1 PL/SQL functions Review `plsql_func.sql` which creates a PL/SQL stored function `myfunc()` to insert a row into a new table named **ptab** and return double the inserted value:

<pre>create table ptab (mydata varchar(20), myid number);

        create or replace function myfunc(d_p in varchar2, i_p in number) return number as
          begin
            insert into ptab (mydata, myid) values (d_p, i_p);
            return (i_p * 2);
          end;
        /
        </pre>

Run the script using:

<pre>**sqlplus /nolog @plsql_func.sql**</pre>

Review the code contained in `plsql_func.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        res = cur.callfunc('myfunc', int, ('abc', 2))
        print(res)
        </pre>

This uses `callfunc()` to execute the function. The second parameter is the type of the returned value. It should be one of the types supported by cx_Oracle or one of the type constants defined by cx_Oracle (such as cx_Oracle.NUMBER). The two PL/SQL function parameters are passed as a tuple and bound to the function parameter arguments. From a terminal window, run:

<pre>**python plsql_func.py**</pre>

The output is a result of the PL/SQL function calculation. * #### 5.2 PL/SQL procedures Review `plsql_proc.sql` which creates a PL/SQL procedure `myproc()` to accept two parameters. The second parameter contains an OUT return value.

<pre>create or replace procedure myproc(v1_p in number, v2_p out number) as
        begin
          v2_p := v1_p * 2;
        end;
        /
        </pre>

Run the script with:

<pre>**sqlplus /nolog @plsql_proc.sql**</pre>

Review the code contained in `plsql_proc.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        myvar = cur.var(int)
        cur.callproc('myproc', (123, myvar))
        print(myvar.getvalue())
        </pre>

This creates an integer variable `myvar` to hold the value returned by the PL/SQL OUT parameter. The input number 123 and the output variable name are bound to the procedure call parameters using a tuple. To call the PL/SQL procedure, the `callproc()` method is used. In a terminal window, run:

<pre>**python plsql_proc.py**</pre>

The `getvalue()` method displays the returned value. * ### <a name="handlers">6\. Type Handlers</a> * #### 6.1 Basic output type handler Output type handlers enable applications to change how data is fetched from the database. For example, numbers can be returned as strings or decimal objects. LOBs can be returned as string or bytes. A type handler is enabled by setting the `outputtypehandler` attribute on either a cursor or the connection. If set on a cursor it only affects queries executed by that cursor. If set on a connection it affects all queries executed on cursors created by that connection. Review the code contained in `type_output.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        print("Standard output...")
        for row in cur.execute("select * from dept"):
            print(row)
        </pre>

In a terminal window, run:

<pre>**python type_output.py**</pre>

This shows the department number represented as digits like `10`. Add an output type handler to the bottom of file:

<pre>**def ReturnNumbersAsStrings(cursor, name, defaultType, size, precision, scale):
            if defaultType == cx_Oracle.NUMBER:
                return cursor.var(str, 9, cursor.arraysize)

        print("Output type handler output...")
        cur = con.cursor()
        cur.outputtypehandler = ReturnNumbersAsStrings
        for row in cur.execute("select * from dept"):
            print(row)**
        </pre>

This type handler converts any number columns to strings with maxium size 9\. Run the script again:

<pre>**python type_output.py**</pre>

The new output shows the department numbers are now strings within quotes like `'10'`. * #### 6.2 Output type handlers and variable converters When numbers are fetched from the database, the conversion from Oracle's decimal representation to Python's binary format may need careful handling. To avoid unexpected issues, the general recommendation is to do number operations in SQL or PL/SQL, or to use the decimal module in Python. Output type handlers can be combined with variable converters to change how data is fetched. Review `type_converter.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        for value, in cur.execute("select 0.1 from dual"):
            print("Value:", value, "* 3 =", value * 3)
        </pre>

Run the file:

<pre>**python type_converter.py**</pre>

The output is like:

<pre>Value: 0.1 * 3 = 0.30000000000000004</pre>

Edit the file and add a type handler that uses a Python decimal converter:

<pre>import cx_Oracle
        **import decimal**

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        **def ReturnNumbersAsDecimal(cursor, name, defaultType, size, precision, scale):
            if defaultType == cx_Oracle.NUMBER:
                return cursor.var(str, 9, cursor.arraysize, outconverter = decimal.Decimal)

        cur.outputtypehandler = ReturnNumbersAsDecimal**

        for value, in cur.execute("select 0.1 from dual"):
            print("Value:", value, "* 3 =", value * 3)
        </pre>

The Python `decimal.Decimal` converter gets called with the string representation of the Oracle number. The output from `decimal.Decimal` is returned in the output tuple. Run the file:

<pre>**python type_converter.py**</pre>

Output is like:

<pre>Value: 0.1 * 3 = 0.3</pre>

Although the code demonstrates the use of outconverter, in this particular case, the variable can be created simply by using the following code to replace the outputtypehandler function defined above:

<pre>def ReturnNumbersAsDecimal(cursor, name, defaultType, size, precision, scale):
            if defaultType == cx_Oracle.NUMBER:
                return cursor.var(decimal.Decimal, arraysize = cursor.arraysize)
        </pre>

* #### 6.3 Input type handlers Input type handlers enable applications to change how data is bound to statements, or to enable new types to be bound directly without having to be converted individually. Review `type_input.py`, which is similar to the final `bind_sdo.py` from section 4.4, with the addition of a new class and converter (shown in bold):

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        # Create table
        cur.execute("""begin
                         execute immediate 'drop table testgeometry';
                         exception when others then
                           if sqlcode <> -942 then
                             raise;
                           end if;
                       end;""")
        cur.execute("""create table testgeometry (
                       id number(9) not null,
                       geometry MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY not null)""")

        **# Create a Python class for an SDO
        class mySDO(object):

            def __init__(self, gtype, elemInfo, ordinates):
                self.gtype = gtype
                self.elemInfo = elemInfo
                self.ordinates = ordinates

        # Get Oracle type information
        objType = con.gettype("MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY")
        elementInfoTypeObj = con.gettype("MDSYS.SDO_ELEM_INFO_ARRAY")
        ordinateTypeObj = con.gettype("MDSYS.SDO_ORDINATE_ARRAY")

        # Convert a Python object to MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY
        def SDOInConverter(value):
            obj = objType.newobject()
            obj.SDO_GTYPE = value.gtype
            obj.SDO_ELEM_INFO = elementInfoTypeObj.newobject()
            obj.SDO_ELEM_INFO.extend(value.elemInfo)
            obj.SDO_ORDINATES = ordinateTypeObj.newobject()
            obj.SDO_ORDINATES.extend(value.ordinates)
            return obj

        def SDOInputTypeHandler(cursor, value, numElements):
            if isinstance(value, mySDO):
                return cursor.var(cx_Oracle.OBJECT, arraysize = numElements,
                        inconverter = SDOInConverter, typename = objType.name)

        sdo = mySDO(2003, [1, 1003, 3], [1, 1, 5, 7])  # Python object
        cur.inputtypehandler = SDOInputTypeHandler
        cur.execute("insert into testgeometry values (:1, :2)", (1, sdo))**

        # Define a function to dump the contents of an Oracle object
        def dumpobject(obj, prefix = "  "):
            if obj.type.iscollection:
                print(prefix, "[")
                for value in obj.aslist():
                    if isinstance(value, cx_Oracle.Object):
                        dumpobject(value, prefix + "  ")
                    else:
                        print(prefix + "  ", repr(value))
                print(prefix, "]")
            else:
                print(prefix, "{")
                for attr in obj.type.attributes:
                    value = getattr(obj, attr.name)
                    if isinstance(value, cx_Oracle.Object):
                        print(prefix + "  " + attr.name + " :")
                        dumpobject(value, prefix + "    ")
                    else:
                        print(prefix + "  " + attr.name + " :", repr(value))
                print(prefix, "}")

        # Query the row
        print("Querying row just inserted...")
        cur.execute("select id, geometry from testgeometry")
        for (id, obj) in cur:
            print("Id: ", id)
            dumpobject(obj)
        </pre>

In the new file, a Python class `mySDO` is defined, which has attributes corresponding to each Oracle MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY attribute. The `mySDO` class is used lower in the code to create a Python instance:

<pre>sdo = mySDO(2003, [1, 1003, 3], [1, 1, 5, 7])</pre>

which is then directly bound into the INSERT statement like:

<pre>cur.execute("insert into testgeometry values (:1, :2)", (1, sdo))</pre>

The mapping between Python and Oracle objects is handled in `SDOInConverter` which uses the cx_Oracle `newobject()` and `extend()` methods to create an Oracle object from the Python object values. The `SDOInConverter` method is called by the input type handler `SDOInputTypeHandler` whenever an instance of `mySDO` is inserted with the cursor. To confirm the behavior, run the file:

<pre>**python type_input.py**</pre>

* ### <a name="lobs">7\. LOBs</a> * #### 7.1 Fetching a CLOB using a locator Review the code contained in `clob.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        print("Inserting data...")
        cur.execute("truncate table testclobs")
        longString = ""
        for i in range(5):
            char = chr(ord('A') + i)
            longString += char * 250
            cur.execute("insert into testclobs values (:1, :2)",
                           (i + 1, "String data " + longString + ' End of string'))
        con.commit()

        print("Querying data...")
        cur.prepare("select * from testclobs where id = :id")
        cur.execute(None, {'id': 1})
        (id, clob) = cur.fetchone()
        print("CLOB length:", clob.size())
        clobdata = clob.read()
        print("CLOB data:", clobdata)
        </pre>

This inserts some test string data and then fetches one record into `clob`, which is a cx_Oracle LOB Object. Methods on LOB include `size()` and `read()`. To see the output, run the file:

<pre>**python clob.py**</pre>

Edit the file and experiment reading chunks of data by giving start character position and length, such as `clob.read(1,10)` * #### 7.2 Fetching a CLOB as a string For CLOBs small enough to fit in the application memory, it is much faster to fetch them directly as strings. Review the code contained in `clob_string.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        print("Inserting data...")
        cur.execute("truncate table testclobs")
        longString = ""
        for i in range(5):
            char = chr(ord('A') + i)
            longString += char * 250
            cur.execute("insert into testclobs values (:1, :2)",
                        (i + 1, "String data " + longString + ' End of string'))
        con.commit()

        **def OutputTypeHandler(cursor, name, defaultType, size, precision, scale):
            if defaultType == cx_Oracle.CLOB:
                return cursor.var(cx_Oracle.LONG_STRING, arraysize = cursor.arraysize)

        con.outputtypehandler = OutputTypeHandler**

        print("Querying data...")
        cur.prepare("select * from testclobs where id = :id")
        cur.execute(None, {'id': 1})
        **(id, clobdata) = cur.fetchone()
        print("CLOB length:", len(clobdata))
        print("CLOB data:", clobdata)**
        </pre>

The OutputTypeHandler causes cx_Oracle to fetch the CLOB as a string. Standard Python string functions such as `len()` can be used on the result. The output is the same as for `clob.py`. To check, run the file:

<pre>**python clob_string.py**</pre>

* ### <a name="rowfactory">8\. Rowfactory functions</a> Rowfactory functions enable queries to return objects other than tuples. They can be used to provide names for the various columns or to return custom objects. * #### 8.1 Rowfactory for mapping column names Review the code contained in `rowfactory.py`:

<pre>import collections
        import cx_Oracle

        con = cx_Oracle.connect("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")
        cur = con.cursor()

        cur.execute("select deptno, dname from dept")
        rows = cur.fetchall()

        print('Array indexes:')
        for row in rows:
            print(row[0], "->", row[1])

        print('Loop target variables:')
        for c1, c2 in rows:
            print(c1, "->", c2)
        </pre>

This shows two methods of accessing result set items from a data row. The first uses array indexes like `row[0]`. The second uses loop target variables which take the values of each row tuple. Run the file:

<pre>**python rowfactory.py**</pre>

Both access methods gives the same results. To use a rowfactory function, edit `rowfactory.py` and add:

<pre>**print('Rowfactory:')
        cur.execute("select deptno, dname from dept")
        cur.rowfactory = collections.namedtuple("MyClass", ["DeptNumber", "DeptName"])

        rows = cur.fetchall()
        for row in rows:
            print(row.DeptNumber, "->", row.DeptName)** </pre>

This uses the Python factory function `namedtuple()` to create a subclass of tuple that allows access to the elements via indexes or the given field names. The `print()` function shows the use of the new named tuple fields. This coding style can help reduce coding errors. Run the script again:

<pre>**python rowfactory.py**</pre>

The output results are the same. * ### <a name="subclass">9\. Subclassing connections and cursors</a> Subclassing enables application to "hook" connection and cursor creation. This can be used to alter or log connection and execution parameters, and to extend cx_Oracle functionality. * #### 9.1 Subclassing connections Review the code contained in `subclass.py`:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        class MyConnection(cx_Oracle.Connection):

            def __init__(self):
                print("Connecting to database")
                return super(MyConnection, self).__init__("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

        con = MyConnection()
        cur = con.cursor()

        cur.execute("select count(*) from emp where deptno = :bv", (10,))
        count, = cur.fetchone()
        print("Number of rows:", count)
        </pre>

This creates a new class "MyConnection" that inherits from the cx_Oracle Connection class. The `__init__` method is invoked when an instance of the new class is created. It prints a message and calls the base class, passing the connection credentials. In the "normal" application, the application code:

<pre>con = MyConnection()</pre>

does not need to supply any credentials, as they are embedded in the custom subclass. All the cx_Oracle methods such as `cursor()` are available, as shown by the query. Run the file:

<pre>**python subclass.py**</pre>

The query executes successfully. * #### 9.2 Subclassing cursors Edit `subclass.py` and extend the `cursor()` method with a new MyCursor class:

<pre>import cx_Oracle

        class MyConnection(cx_Oracle.Connection):

            def __init__(self):
                print("Connecting to database")
                return super(MyConnection, self).__init__("pythonhol", "welcome", "localhost/orclpdb")

         **def cursor(self):
                return MyCursor(self)

        class MyCursor(cx_Oracle.Cursor):

           def execute(self, statement, args):
               print("Executing:", statement)
               print("Arguments:")
               for argIndex, arg in enumerate(args):
                   print("  Bind", argIndex + 1, "has value", repr(arg))
                   return super(MyCursor, self).execute(statement, args)

           def fetchone(self):
               print("Fetchone()")
               return super(MyCursor, self).fetchone()**

        con = MyConnection()
        cur = con.cursor()

        cur.execute("select count(*) from emp where deptno = :bv", (10,))
        count, = cur.fetchone()
        print("Number of rows:", count)
        </pre>

When the application gets a cursor from the `MyConnection` class, the new `cursor()` method returns an instance of our new `MyCursor` class. The "application" query code remains unchanged. The new `execute()` and `fetchone()` methods of the `MyCursor` class get invoked. They do some logging and invoke the parent methods to do the actual statement execution. To confirm this, run the file again:

<pre>**python subclass.py**</pre>

This file sets up Advanced Queuing using Oracle's DBMS_AQADM package. The queue is used for passing Oracle UDT_BOOK objects. Run the file:

<pre>**python aq.py**</pre>

The output shows messages being queued and dequeued. To experiment, split the code into three files: one to create and start the queue, and two other files to queue and dequeue messages. Experiment running the queue and dequeue files concurrently in separate terminal windows. If you are stuck, look in the `solutions` directory at the `aq-dequeue.py`, `aq-enqueue.py` and `aq-queuestart.py` files. Try changing the dequeue options and mode. For example change the dequeue `options.wait` value to `cx_Oracle.DEQ_WAIT_FOREVER`. ## <a name="summary">Summary</a> In this tutorial, you have learned how to: * Create connections * Use sessions pooling and Database Resident Connection Pooling * Execute queries and fetch data * Use bind variables * Use PL/SQL stored functions and procedures * Extend cx_Oracle classes * Use Oracle Advanced Queuing ## <a name="primer">Appendix: Python Primer</a> Python is a dynamically typed scripting language. It is most often used to run command-line scripts but is also used in Web applications. #### Running Python You can either: * Create a file of Python commands, such as `myfile.py`. This can be run with:

<pre>**python myfile.py**</pre>

* Alternatively run the Python interpreter by executing the `python` command in a terminal, and then interactively enter commands. Use **Ctrl-D** to exit back to the operating system prompt. #### Indentation Whitespace indentation is significant in Python. When copying examples, use the same column alignment as shown. The samples in this lab use spaces, not tabs. The following indentation prints 'done' once after the loop has completed:

<pre>for i in range(5):
    print(i)
print('done')
</pre>

But this indentation prints 'done' in each iteration:

<pre>for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    print('done')
</pre>

#### Strings Python strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes:

<pre>'A string constant'
"another constant"</pre>

Multi line strings use a triple-quote syntax:

<pre>"""
SELECT *
FROM EMP
"""</pre>

#### Variables Variables do not need types declared:

<pre>count = 1
ename = 'Arnie'</pre>

#### Comments Comments are either single line:

<pre># a short comment</pre>

They can be multi-line using the triple-quote token to create a string that does nothing:

<pre>"""
a longer
comment
"""
</pre>

#### Printing Strings and variables can be displayed with a `print()` function:

<pre>print('Hello, World!')
print('Value:', count)</pre>

Note the [`print`](https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function) syntax and output is different in Python 2\. #### Data Structures Associative arrays are called 'dictionaries':

<pre>a2 = {'PI':3.1415, 'E':2.7182}</pre>

Ordered arrays are called 'lists':

<pre>a3 = [101, 4, 67]</pre>

Lists can be accessed via indexes.

<pre>print(a3[0])
print(a3[-1])
print(a3[1:3])
</pre>

Tuples are like lists but cannot be changed once they are created. They are created with parentheses:

<pre>a4 = (3, 7, 10)</pre>

Individual values in a tuple can be assigned to variables like:

<pre>v1, v2, v3 = a4</pre>

Now the variable v1 contains 3, the variable v2 contains 7 and the variable v3 contains 10\. The value in a single entry tuple like "`(13,)`"can be assigned to a variable by putting a comma after the variable name like:

<pre>v1, = (13,)</pre>

If the assignment is:

<pre>v1 = (13,)</pre>

then `v1` will contain the whole tuple "`(13,)`" #### Objects Everything in Python is an object. As an example, given the of the list `a3` above, the `append()` method can be used to add a value to the list.

<pre>a3.append(23)</pre>

Now `a3` contains `[101, 4, 67, 23]` #### Flow Control Code flow can be controlled with tests and loops. The `if`/`elif`/`else` statements look like:

<pre>if sal > 900000:
    print('Salary is way too big')
elif sal > 500000:
    print('Salary is huge')
else:
    print('Salary might be OK')
</pre>

This also shows how the clauses are delimited with colons, and each sub block of code is indented. #### Loops A traditional loop is:

<pre>for i in range(10):
    print(i)</pre>

This prints the numbers from 0 to 9\. The value of `i` is incremented in each iteration. The '`for`' command can also be used to iterate over lists and tuples:

<pre>a5 = ['Aa', 'Bb', 'Cc']
for v in a5:
    print(v)
</pre>

This sets `v` to each element of the list `a5` in turn. #### Functions A function may be defined as:

<pre>def myfunc(p1, p2):
    "Function documentation: add two numbers"
    print(p1, p2)
    return p1 + p2</pre>

Functions may or may not return values. This function could be called using:

<pre>v3 = myfunc(1, 3)</pre>

Function calls must appear after their function definition. Functions are also objects and have attributes. The inbuilt `__doc__` attribute can be used to find the function description:

<pre>print(myfunc.__doc__)</pre>

#### Modules Sub-files can be included in Python scripts with an import statement.

<pre>import os
import sys</pre>

Many predefined modules exist, such as the os and the sys modules. ## <a name="resources">Resources</a> * [Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) * [Python cx_Oracle Documentation](http://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) * [Python cx_Oracle Source Code Repository](https://github.com/oracle/python-cx_Oracle)
